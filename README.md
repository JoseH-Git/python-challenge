# python-challenge

**PyBank**

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

As an example, the analysis should look similar to the one below:

In addition, this script print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

**PyPoll**

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

As an example, the analysis should look similar to the one below:

In addition, this script printa the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
